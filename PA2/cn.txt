A Top-Down Approach
Computer networking can seem enormously complex after all, the Internet is in many ways the largest engineered system ever built by humankind! Networking involves many concepts, protocols, and technologies that are woven together in an intricate manner. To cope with this scope and complexity, many computer networking texts are often organized around the "layers" of a network architecture. With a layered organization, students can see through the complexity of computer networking-they learn about the distinct concepts and protocols in one part of the architecture while seeing the big picture of how all parts fit together. From a pedagogical perspective, our personal experience has been that such a layered approach indeed works well. Nevertheless, we have found that the traditional approach of teaching-bottom up; that is, from the physical layer towards the application layer is not the best approach for a modern course on computer networking.
